👋 Hi, I’m @ItsHaname

👀 I’m interested in computer science, anime, and exploring creative solutions in tech.
🌱 I’m currently learning programming concepts, computer memory systems, and improving my skills in languages like Python and JavaScript.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly open-source projects,web or app development, and anything that helps me grow as a developer.
