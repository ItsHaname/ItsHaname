- 👋 Hi, I’m @ItsHaname
- 👀  I’m a student of Applied Computer Science at FSSM, still exploring all things tech and deeply into programming and coding.
- 🌱 Currently mastering JavaScript (or at least trying), experimenting with shell scripting,and trying to decode the mysteries of computer architecture
- 💞️  Not yet into collaborations,but open to learning and growing with cool projects down the road.
- 📫  Reach me here on GitHub or  via email at h.aitbah8410@gmail.com for all things tech and random thoughts.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact:I enjoy instrumental music, and sometimes I try to make sense of complex ideas… and sometimes I just end up with more questions than answers
